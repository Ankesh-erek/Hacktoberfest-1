- Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
- Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database.


## Aim
To develop a Face Recognition System using openCV and record the Name and Time of the person's apperance in front of the camera.


## Purpose
The purpose is to Build A Real-Time Face Recognition End-To-End Project.


## Short Description
- This project is done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
- OpenCV
        - OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on     real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.

## Requirements
- Tools
	- Install python 3
	- Any IDE's, I have used Pycharm IDE.

## Modules required
MAIN 
    - OpenCV(CV2)
    - OS
    - Datetime
    - numpy
    - face-recognition
## Support
    - cmake
    - colorama
    - dlib
    - enum34
    - nicer
    - pip
    - pkt
    - pytz
    - setuptools
    - typing

## Steps to run:
- Install python 3
- Open the IDE or python console
- Enter $ python3 File_name.py to run the code.

## IDE:-
  I have used PyCharm, it is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
providing a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated
to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development.

## Steps to run:
- st-1:
    Under files -> settings -> interpreter install all modules
- st-2:
    set Face_recognition1.py as the script file in path
- st-3:
    Add all Images to be trained under train_images folder in format
    Name.jpg or Name.jpeg

- st-4:
    You are set up can run the script
