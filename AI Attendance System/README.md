- Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
- Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database.


## Aim
To develop a Face Recognition System using openCV and record the Name and Time of the person's apperance in front of the camera.


## Purpose
The purpose is to Build A Real-Time Face Recognition End-To-End Project.


## Short Description
- This project is done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
- OpenCV
        - OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on     real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.
